Placement of Rate Limiter

There are multiple ways to place a rate limiter in a system:

1) Before the API Servers
    - The rate limiter sits in front of the API servers and filters requests before they reach the servers.

    PROS:
      - Enhanced security.
      - Reduced load on API servers by blocking unnecessary requests early.

    CONS:
      - Increased latency due to the extra hop.
      - Single point of failure: if the rate limiter fails, all traffic is affected.

2) Within the API Servers
    - Each API server implements its own rate limiting logic.

    PROS:
      - Granular control: allows for custom rate limiting per server or service.
      - No central point of failure.

    CONS:
      - Increased server load, as each server must handle rate limiting in addition to its main tasks.
