-> Capacity estimation is basically our throughput 
-> So we can divide that into two parts write throughput and Read throughput 
-> So incase of our system basically write throughput means basically what all write functionality are we doing 
so (1) User wants to post something (2)When user follows or unfollow eachother and laste is (3) Like and comment that also is write stuff on OUR DB
-> So we assume the write throughput is basically 50 Million request / Daily
-> And our read throughput is basically 50 billion request / Daily
