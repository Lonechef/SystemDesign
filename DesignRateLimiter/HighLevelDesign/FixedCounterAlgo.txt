-> SO now over here in this basically a fixed req is set per minut any req coming above that for particular seconds the request will be rejected so basically max request allowed per minute 
-> Every window has the a ceratain requesst per minuhtew
-> All the extra requests will be limited 
-> SO that extra requests will be queued for the next request 

Explanation of Fixed Window Counter Algorithm:
- The Fixed Window Counter algorithm divides time into fixed-size windows (e.g., 1 minute).
- For each window, a counter tracks the number of requests.
- If the number of requests in the current window exceeds the allowed limit, further requests are rejected until the next window starts.
- At the start of a new window, the counter resets to zero.

Pros:
- Simple to implement and understand.
- Low memory usage, as only a single counter per window is needed.
- Efficient for use cases where strict rate limits are acceptable.

Cons:
- Can allow burst traffic at window boundaries (e.g., max requests at the end of one window and again at the start of the next).
- Not suitable for scenarios requiring smooth rate limiting.
- May cause uneven request distribution.
