- The client first sends a request to the Rate Limiter.
- The Rate Limiter checks if the client has exceeded the allowed number of requests within a specific time window.
- If the request is within the allowed limit, the Rate Limiter forwards it to the API Server; otherwise, it rejects or notifies the client.
- Storing request counts in a traditional database is not feasible due to high frequency and latency concerns.
- Redis is a suitable option for storing and checking request counts efficiently because of its speed and support for atomic operations.
