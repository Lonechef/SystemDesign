-> So basically wp uses the end to end encryption method to keep our messages safe from the hacker so the message do not gets leaked for that system follows lock and key mechanism so  basically in this scenario what happens is basically you send a message to you freind and attach a lock on it now only you friend has the key to open that message so now even if hacker hacks the message then he dosent have the key to open that mesage or in other words he donot have key to decrypt that message
